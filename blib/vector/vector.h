 *
 * In a normal vector (with no generation rule i.e.: genrule = NULL)
 * size is the real size of the vector. In a generator (i.e.:
 * genrule != NULL) size is an indicator for caching purposes, it is not
 * necessary to keep a generator's real size since it is always 2; its
 * first element is the starting condition (from where generation rule
 * proliferates) whilst its second element is the element cached at position
 * size.
 *
 * Length is the virtual size of the vector i.e. the usable one. In a generator
 * it can be used to limit its growth.
 *
 * genrule, function pointer to define generation rule behaviour. Function
 * should receive a number (current element) and return the next one.
